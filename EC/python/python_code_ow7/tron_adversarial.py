    Tron Adversarial represents the game, it has:

     - a board, which is a square toroidal grid
     - a canvas which is used when drawing and displaying the player
     - a player which controls the bike that is constantly moving forward and
       leaves a trail

    **STU Tron** game flow:

    *Initialization*
      The board, player and canvas are initialized. The listeners of the
      canvas are initialized

    *Run*
      Update the player each step of the game. The direction of the player is
      updated by key events. The key events trigger an :ref:`actions` of a
      player:

       - A human player presses the '<' or '>' arrow on the keyboard. The
         direction of the player is changed and the canvas is redrawn.
       - An AI player executes a strategy

    *Cleanup*
      The game ends when the player collides with and obstacle. Close the GUI and
      write the statistics of the game to a log file.

    Attributes:

    - Canvas -- Used for displaying the GUI
    - Rows -- The number of cells on the board
    - Board -- The board where player moves. Keeps track of the trail that
      the bike leaves behind
    - Bike Width -- The width in pixels of the bike. Used when drawing the
      bike on the GUI
    - Draw board -- Indicator for turning the GUI on or off.
    - Players -- The players controlling the bike. The initial position of the
      players are close to the center of the board and the initial direction is facing
      south
    - Strategy -- The predefined strategy of an ai player, if the strategy is
      `None` a human can control the player
    - Winner -- The player who won

    .. note:: Executing **STU Tron** without a GUI is faster. There is no
       need to draw on the canvas and DELAY each step.
