   **STU Tron** Non-Adversarial, The player is squaring off with itself.

**STU Tron** Game description:
------------------------------

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

There are some components in the **STU Tron** game:

**Player**
  Controls the *direction* of a *Bike*, The **PlayerAI** controls the bike by
  using a predefined strategy.

  .. _directions:

  *Directions* are:

  - East -- (1, 0), 0 degrees
  - North -- (0, 1), 90 degrees
  - West -- (-1, 0), 180 degrees
  - South -- (0, -1), 270 degrees

  *Bike* properties:

  - Moves ahead in the current direction with constant speed.
  - Leaves a *trail* on each square that has been visited. The
    tron_non_adversarial_ex_ shows the bike and the trail on the board.

.. figure:: images/toroidal.png
   :align: right
   :width: 200px
   :height: 100px
   :alt: Toroidal grid
   :figclass: align-center

   The **board** is donut shaped, i.e. a toroidal grid.

**Board**
  A square toroidal grid with length *n*, i.e. donut shaped

  - Exit at the north of the board and enter at the south of the board
  - Exit at the south of the board and enter at the north of the board
  - Exit to the west of the board and enter to the east of the board
  - Exit to the east of the board and enter to the west of the board

**Tron**
  The game contains the logic, checks for I/O events and coordinates
  the components.

.. note:: The **STU Tron** can be displayed in a GUI by passing the `-d` flag
   when starting the game.

Rules
~~~~~

The rules of the game:

- Score is given by the length of the trail. The maximum score is *n* * *n*
- Game ends when the bike hits the trail

.. _actions:

Actions
~~~~~~~

The player can take three actions in order to change direction:

- Left -- '<' turn player 90 degrees to the left
- Right -- '>' turn player 90 degrees to the right
- Ahead -- do nothing, i.e. do not change direction

Running **STU Tron** non-adversarial

    Player controls the bike in the STU Tron game, i.e. it is the bike. The
    player can draw
    its trail on the canvas.

    The player update consists of:

    - move the bike forward by adding the direction to
      the current coordinate.
    - append the new coordinate to the trail
    - check if the player has collided with the trail

    The actions are described in: :ref:`actions`
